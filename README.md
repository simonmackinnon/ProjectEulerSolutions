# ProjectEulerSolutions

Project Euler is a mathematics/coding website. There are a series of questions at https://projecteuler.net/ for which I have attempted some. 
This repository lists my solutions for the questions that I have answered correctly.

Some notes about this repository:
(a) I welcome feedback (negative or positive) on these.
(b) Many of the solutions don't contain details of the question. The file names indicate which question the code relates to.
(c) All of these solutions were created before the login was disabled to to the Heartbleed bug. I haven't re-registered since then.
